Inspired by the original [Siddharth Kshetrapal / Bundlesize](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize)

# Getting Started and Configuration
Follow the documentation on [bundlesize.io](http://bundlesize.io/)



## Why the change in direction from the original?
- The original bundlesize has entered maintenance mode, pull requests are left hanging, we wanted to reboost the community and start growing bundlesize out
- Split store into seperate app -> bundlesize/service with infrastructure as code
- Launched documentation website
- Enough test coverage to support CD
- Node API Support
- Lower the barrier to contributing, build a trusted community of contributors to have continous improvement


### New features:
- [x] Config validation to stop users guessing why bundlesize won't work
- [x] New and improved CI behaviour
- [x] Better comparisons between branches, support branches other than master
- [ ] Show history of bundlesizes over time (Coming soon)
