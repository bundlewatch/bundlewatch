  <h1>BundleWatch</h1>
  <p>
    BundleWatch checks file sizes, ensuring bundled browser assets don't jump in file size. <br />
    Sharp increases in BundleWatch can signal that something is wrong - adding a package that bloats the slug, a wrong import, or forgetting to minify.

# Getting Started:
Install the BundleWatch package:
- NPM: `npm install bundlewatch --save-dev`
- Yarn: `yarn add bundlewatch --dev`

Add some basic configuration to your .package.json`
```json
{
    "name": "my package name",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "bundlewatch" : {
        "files": [
            {
                "path": "myfolder/*.js",
                "maxSize": "100kB"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Usage:
- NPM: `npm run bundlewatch`
- Yarn: `yarn run bundlewatch`

This will give you command line output. If you want BundleWatch to report build status on your pull requests, see below.


# Adding Build Status:
BundleWatch can report its status on your GitHub Pull Requests.

<div align="center">

</div>

## CI Auth Variables Needed by BundleWatch:
- `BUNDLEWATCH_GITHUB_TOKEN`

You will need to give BundleWatch access to your GitHub Statuses, which can be done by heading to:
https://service.bundlewatch.io/setup-github

This will give you your `BUNDLEWATCH_GITHUB_TOKEN`. You will need to set this as an environment variable in CI.


## CI Variables Needed by BundleWatch:
The most efficient way to get this running is to ensure that some environment variables are available for BundleWatch to find.
- `CI_REPO_OWNER` github.com/**facebook**/react
- `CI_REPO_NAME`  github.com/facebook/**react**
- `CI_COMMIT_SHA`
- `CI_BRANCH`

If you're using, _Travis_, _CircleCI_ or _Wrecker_ these should all work out of the box.

> Have a look at the source code to see which variables are automatically found: https://github.com/bundlewatch/bundlewatch/blob/master/src/app/config/ciEnv.js#L36-L39





## Viewing the results breakdown
After setting up the above you will have BuildStatus on your Pull Requests. Clicking the _details_ link on the reported status will show you a results file breakdown.

# Additional Documentation:
Full [documentation avialable on bundlewatch.io](http://bundlewatch.io/)



# I use bundlesize, why should I switch to BundleWatch?
- Bundlesize has entered maintenance mode and pull requests are left hanging, so we wanted to reboot the community through creating BundleWatch
- [BundleWatch/service](https://github.com/bundlewatch/service) with infrastructure as code
- Launched documentation website
- Enough test coverage to support CD
- Node API Support
- Lower barrier to contributing, build a trusted community of contributors to have continuous improvement

### Additional Features:
- [x] Config validation to stop users from guessing why BundleWatch won't work
- [x] Support for config file path
- [x] Better results breakdown page [see diffing against branches](http://bundlewatch.io/#/getting-started/the-best-parts?id=diffing-against-branches-other-than-master)
- [x] Better comparisons between branches, support branches other than master
- [x] Support for your own server for storing data
- [x] New and improved CI behaviour
- [ ] Show history of BundleWatchs over time (coming soon)
